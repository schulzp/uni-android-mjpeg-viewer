	Abstract = {In rock climbing, discussing climbing techniques with others to master a specific route getting practical advice from more experienced climbers is an inherent part of the culture and tradition of the sport. Spatial information, such as the position of holds, as well as learning complex body postures plays a major role in this process. A typical problem that occurs during advising, is an alignment effect when trying to picture orientation-specific knowledge, e.g. explaining how to perform a certain self-climbed move to others. We propose betaCube, a self-calibrating camera-projection unit that features 3D tracking and distortion-free projection. The system enables a life-sized video replay and climbing route creation using augmented reality. We contribute an interface for automatic setup of mobile and distortion free projection, blob detection for climbing holds, as well as an automatic method for extracting planar trackables from artificial climbing walls.},

@article{Wright01062001,
	Abstract = {Objectives---To determine the frequency of overuse injury in indoor climbers, the common sites of such injury, and the factors that influence the probability that a climber will have sustained an overuse injury while climbing indoors.Method---A semisupervised questionnaire was used to survey overuse injury in 295 spectators and competitors at the Entre-Prises World Climbing Championships held in Birmingham 3--5 December 1999. Statistical analysis included simple cross tabulations, calculation of odds ratios, and multiple logistic regression to explore the effect of several factors simultaneously.Results---Some 44\% of respondents had sustained an overuse injury, 19\% at more than one site. The most common site of injury was the fingers. Univariate analysis showed that the probability of having sustained a climbing injury is higher in men (p = 0.009), those who have climbed for more than 10 years (p = 0.006), those who climb harder routes (p<0.0005), and those who boulder or lead more than they top rope (p<0.0005). The relation between lead grade and climbing injury is linear. Multivariate analysis removed the effect of sex as an independent predictor.Conclusions---Many climbers sustain overuse injury. The most at risk are those with the most ability and dedication to climbing. Climbers should be aware of the risk factors that influence injury and be able to spot the signs and symptoms of injury once they occur.},

Features in the video are automatically tracked and grouped in an off-line preprocess that enables later interactive manipulation. Examples of annotations include speech and thought balloons, video graffiti, path arrows, video hyperlinks, and schematic storyboards. We also demonstrate a direct-manipulation interface for random frame access using spatial constraints, and a drag-and-drop interface for assembling still images from videos.

	Abstract = {<p> In outdoor rock climbing, routes are commonly marked in <italic>topos</italic>, which are typically implemented as annotated photographs or hand-drawn pictures. 3D technologies, such as structure from motion (SfM), enable the creation of detailed 3D models. These technologies are now within the reach of almost everybody, and they are becoming increasingly simple to utilize. We present an interactive 3D topo of a large boulder and discuss the creation process using SfM and 3D modelling software. Furthermore, we conducted an online user study with 52 respondents investigating how 3D topos can be utilized for information sharing and planning, and how 3D topos might change rock climbing. Results show that 3D topos are seen highly useful compared to normal web topos. </p>},
